    # Introduction
    AeroAPI is a simple, query-based API that gives software developers access
    to a variety of FlightAware's flight data. Users can obtain current or
    historical data. AeroAPI is a RESTful API delivering accurate and
    actionable aviation data. With the introduction of Foresight™, customers
    have access to the data that powers over half of the predictive airline
    ETAs in the US.

    ## Categories
    AeroAPI is divided into several categories to make things easier to
    discover.
    - Flights: Summary information, planned routes, positions and more
    - Foresight: Flight positions enhanced with FlightAware Foresight™
    - Airports: Airport information and FIDS style resources
    - Operators: Operator information and fleet activity resources
    - Alerts: Configure flight alerts and delivery destinations
    - History: Historical flight access for various endpoints
    - Miscellaneous: Flight disruption, future schedule information, and aircraft owner information

    ## Development Tools
    AeroAPI is defined using the OpenAPI Spec 3.0, which means it can be easily
    imported into tools like Postman. To get started try importing the API
    specification using
    [Postman's instructions](https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI/).
    Once imported as a collection only the "Value" field under the collection's
    Authorization tab needs to be populated and saved before making calls.

    The AeroAPI OpenAPI specification is located at:\
    https://flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/resources/aeroapi-openapi.yml

    Our [open source AeroApps project](/aeroapi/portal/resources)
    provides a small collection of services and sample applications to help
    you get started.

    The Flight Information Display System (FIDS) AeroApp is an example of a
    multi-tier application using multiple languages and Docker containers.
    It demonstrates connectivity, data caching, flight presentation, and leveraging flight maps.

    The Alerts AeroApp demonstrates the use of AeroAPI to set, edit, and
    receive alerts in a sample application with a Dockerized Python backend
    and a React frontend.

    Our AeroAPI push notification [testing interface](/commercial/aeroapi/send.rvt)
    provides a quick and easy way to test the delivery of customized alerts via AeroAPI push.

      AeroAPI alerting can be used to configure and receive real-time alerts on key flight
      events. With customizable alerting offered by our alert endpoints, AeroAPI empowers
      users to selectively pick various types of events/filters to alert on. By doing so,
      you can receive specially tailored alerts delivered to you for events such as flight plan
      filed, flight departure (out and off), flight arrival (on and in), and more!

      To get started with alerting, the **PUT /alerts/endpoint** endpoint must first be used
      to set up the account-wide default URL that alerts will be delivered to. This step must
      be done before any alerts can be configured and will serve as the fallback URL that all
      alerts will be sent to for the account if a specific delivery URL is not designated on a
      particular alert. If this is not performed before configuring alerts, then you will
      receive a 400 error with an error message reminding you of this step when trying to interact
      with the **POST /alerts** endpoint. Once a URL is set via the **PUT /alerts/endpoint** endpoint,
      then alerts can be configured using the **POST /alerts** endpoint. The **GET /alerts** endpoint
      can also be used to retrieve all currently configured alerts associated with your AeroAPI key.
      The **GET /alerts** endpoint will allow you to easily retrieve the id of any specific alerts of
      interest configured for the account which can let you use the **GET** **PUT** and **DELETE**
      **/alerts/{id}** endpoints to retrieve, update, and delete specific alerts.

      When configuring an individual alert, the *target_url* field can be set to a URL that’s
      different than the account-wide target endpoint set via the **PUT /alerts/endpoint**. If
      the *target_url* field is set on an alert, then that specific alert will be delivered to
      the specified *target_url* rather than the default account-wide one. If this field is not
      configured for the alert, then the alert will be delivered to the default account-wide endpoint.
      By setting this field, one can easily target different alerts to be received by different endpoints
      which can be useful for configuring per-application alerts or sending alerts to an alternate
      development environment without having to adjust a production alert configuration.

      For each alert configured, one-to-many ‘events’ can be set for alert delivery. While most
      events will result in one alert delivery, both the *arrival* and the *departure* events can
      result in multiple alerts delivered (referred to as bundled). The *departure* event bundles the
      departure (actual OFF the ground) alert, along with the flight plan filed alert and up to 5
      per-departure changes which can include alerts for significant departure delays of over
      30 minutes, gate changes, and airport delays. FlightAware Global customers will
      also receive *Power on* and *Ready to taxi* alerts as part of the departure bundle. The *arrival* event
      bundles the arrival (actual ON the ground) alert, along with up to 5 en-route changes (including delays
      of over 30 minutes and excluding diversions) identified. FlightAware Global customers will also receive
      *taxi stop* times as part of the *arrival* bundle. Setting a bundled type and unbundled type for an
      On/Off will only result in a single alert in the case where events may overlap.

      If there is a need to change the alert configurations, updating an alert using the **PUT /alerts/{id}**
      endpoint and a unique alert identifier (id) is preferred rather than creating an additional alert.
      By doing so, you can avoid duplicate alerts being delivered which could create unnecessary noise
      if they are not of interest anymore.

      If at any point there is a need to delete an alert, the **DELETE alerts/{id}** endpoint can be
      leveraged to delete an alert so that it won’t be delivered anymore. As a reminder, specific alert
      IDs can be retrieved from the **GET /alerts** endpoint.

      summary: Search for flight positions
      description: |
        Returns flight positions based on geospatial search parameters.  This
        allows you to locate flights that have ever flown within a specific a
        latitude/longitude box, groundspeed, and altitude. It takes search
        terms in a single string comprising of {operator key value} elements
        and returns an array of flight structures. Each search term must be
        enclosed in curly braces. Multiple search terms can be combined in an
        implicit boolean "and" by separating the terms with at least one space.
        This function only searches flight data representing approximately the
        last 24 hours.

        The supported operators include (note that operators take different numbers of arguments):

        * false - results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of false. Example: {false preferred}
        * true - results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of true. Example: {true preferred}
        * null - results must have the specified key set to a null value. Example: {null waypoints}
        * notnull - results must have the specified key not set to a null value. Example: {notnull aircraftType}
        * = - results must have a key that exactly matches the specified value. Example: {= fp C172}
        * != - results must have a key that must not match the specified value. Example: {!= prefix H}
        * < - results must have a key that is lexicographically less-than a specified value. Example: {< arrivalTime 1276811040}
        * \> - results must have a key that is lexicographically greater-than a specified value. Example: {> speed 500}
        * <= - results must have a key that is lexicographically less-than-or-equal-to a specified value. Example: {<= alt 8000}
        * \>= - results must have a key that is lexicographically greater-than-or-equal-to a specified value.
        * match - results must have a key that matches against a case-insensitive wildcard pattern. Example: {match ident AAL*}
        * notmatch - results must have a key that does not match against a case-insensitive wildcard pattern. Example: {notmatch aircraftType B76*}
        * range - results must have a key that is numerically between the two specified values. Example: {range alt 8000 20000}
        * in - results must have a key that exactly matches one of the specified values. Example: {in orig {KLAX KBUR KSNA KLGB}}

        The supported key names include (note that not all of these key names are returned in the result structure, and some have slightly different names):

        * alt - Altitude, measured in hundreds of feet or Flight Level.
        * altChange - a one-character code indicating the change in altitude.
        * cid - a three-character cid code
        * clock - UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
        * fp - unique identifier assigned by FlightAware for this flight, aka fa_flight_id.
        * gs - ground speed, measured in kts.
        * lat - latitude of the reported position.
        * lon - longitude of the reported position
        * updateType - source of the last reported position (P=projected, O=oceanic, Z=radar, A=ADS-B, M=multilateration, D=datalink, X=surface and near surface (ADS-B and ASDE-X), S=space-based)

        Returns currently or recently airborne flights based on geospatial
        search parameters.

        Query parameters include a latitude/longitude box, aircraft ident with
        wildcards, type with wildcards, prefix, origin airport,
        destination airport, origin or destination airport, groundspeed, and
        altitude. It takes search terms in a single string comprising of
        {operator key value} elements and returns an array of flight
        structures. Each search term must be enclosed in curly braces. Multiple
        search terms can be combined in an implicit boolean "and" by separating
        the terms with at least one space. This function only searches flight
        data representing approximately the last 24 hours. Codeshares and
        alternate idents are NOT searched when matching against the ident key.

        The supported operators include (note that operators take different numbers of arguments):

        * false - results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of false. Example: {false arrived}
        * true - results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of true. Example: {true lifeguard}
        * null - results must have the specified key set to a null value. Example: {null waypoints}
        * notnull - results must have the specified key not set to a null value. Example: {notnull aircraftType}
        * = - results must have a key that exactly matches the specified value. Example: {= aircraftType C172}
        * != - results must have a key that must not match the specified value. Example: {!= prefix H}
        * < - results must have a key that is lexicographically less-than a specified value. Example: {< arrivalTime 1276811040}
        * \> - results must have a key that is lexicographically greater-than a specified value. Example: {> speed 500}
        * <= - results must have a key that is lexicographically less-than-or-equal-to a specified value. Example: {<= alt 8000}
        * \>= - results must have a key that is lexicographically greater-than-or-equal-to a specified value.
        * match - results must have a key that matches against a case-insensitive wildcard pattern. Example: {match ident AAL*}
        * notmatch - results must have a key that does not match against a case-insensitive wildcard pattern. Example: {notmatch aircraftType B76*}
        * range - results must have a key that is numerically between the two specified values. Example: {range alt 8000 20000}
        * in - results must have a key that exactly matches one of the specified values. Example: {in orig {KLAX KBUR KSNA KLGB}}
        * orig_or_dest - results must have either the origin or destination key exactly match one of the specified values. Example: {orig_or_dest {KLAX KBUR KSNA KLGB}}
        * airline - results will only include airline flight if the argument is 1, or will only include GA flights if the argument is 0. Example: {airline 1}
        * aircraftType - results must have an aircraftType key that matches one of the specified case-insensitive wildcard patterns. Example: {aircraftType {B76* B77*}}
        * ident - results must have an ident key that matches one of the specified case-insensitive wildcard patterns. Example: {ident {N123* N456* AAL* UAL*}}
        * ident_or_reg - results must have an ident key or was known to be operated by an aircraft registration that matches one of the specified case-insensitive wildcard patterns. Example: {ident_or_reg {N123* N456* AAL* UAL*}}

        The supported key names include (note that not all of these key names are returned in the result structure, and some have slightly different names):

        * actualDepartureTime - Actual time of departure, or null if not departed yet. UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970

            Query to search for airborne or recently arrived flights. It should not
            exceed 1000 bytes in length. Search criteria is only applied to the
            most recent position for a flight. This function only searches flights
            within approximately the last 24 hours. The supported operators include
            (note that operators take different numbers of arguments):

            * false - results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of false. Example: {false arrived}
            * true - results must have the specified boolean key set to a value of true. Example: {true lifeguard}
            * null - results must have the specified key set to a null value. Example: {null waypoints}
            * notnull - results must have the specified key not set to a null value. Example: {notnull aircraftType}
            * = - results must have a key that exactly matches the specified value. Example: {= aircraftType C172}
            * != - results must have a key that must not match the specified value. Example: {!= prefix H}
            * < - results must have a key that is lexicographically less-than a specified value. Example: {< arrivalTime 1276811040}
            * \> - results must have a key that is lexicographically greater-than a specified value. Example: {> speed 500}
            * <= - results must have a key that is lexicographically less-than-or-equal-to a specified value. Example: {<= alt 8000}
            * \>= - results must have a key that is lexicographically greater-than-or-equal-to a specified value.
            * match - results must have a key that matches against a case-insensitive wildcard pattern. Example: {match ident AAL*}
            * notmatch - results must have a key that does not match against a case-insensitive wildcard pattern. Example: {notmatch aircraftType B76*}
            * range - results must have a key that is numerically between the two specified values. Example: {range alt 8000 20000}
            * in - results must have a key that exactly matches one of the specified values. Example: {in orig {KLAX KBUR KSNA KLGB}}
            * orig_or_dest - results must have either the origin or destination key exactly match one of the specified values. Example: {orig_or_dest {KLAX KBUR KSNA KLGB}}
            * airline - results will only include airline flight if the argument is 1, or will only include GA flights if the argument is 0. Example: {airline 1}
            * aircraftType - results must have an aircraftType key that matches one of the specified case-insensitive wildcard patterns. Example: {aircraftType {B76* B77*}}
            * ident - results must have an ident key that matches one of the specified case-insensitive wildcard patterns. Example: {ident {N123* N456* AAL* UAL*}}
            * ident_or_reg - results must have an ident key or was known to be operated by an aircraft registration that matches one of the specified case-insensitive wildcard patterns. Example: {ident_or_reg {N123* N456* AAL* UAL*}}

            The supported key names include (note that not all of these key names are returned in the result structure, and some have slightly different names):

            * actualDepartureTime - Actual time of departure, or null if not departed yet. UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
            * aircraftType - aircraft type ID (for example: B763)
            * alt - altitude at last reported position (hundreds of feet or Flight Level)
            * altChange - altitude change indication (for example: "C" if climbing, "D" if descending, and empty if it is level)
            * arrivalTime - Actual time of arrival, or null if not arrived yet. UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
            * arrived - true if the flight has arrived at its destination.
            * cancelled - true if the flight has been cancelled. The meaning of cancellation is that the flight is no longer being tracked by FlightAware. There are a number of reasons a flight may be cancelled including cancellation by the airline, but that will not always be the case.
            * cdt - Controlled Departure Time, set if there is a ground hold on the flight. UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
            * clock - Time of last received position. UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970

            * dest - ICAO airport code of destination (for example: KLAX)
            * edt - Estimated Departure Time. Epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
            * eta - Estimated Time of Arrival. Epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
            * fdt - Field Departure Time. UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
            * firstPositionTime - Time when first reported position was received, or 0 if no position has been received yet. Epoch timestamp seconds since 1970

            * fp - unique identifier assigned by FlightAware for this flight, aka fa_flight_id.
            * gs - ground speed at last reported position, in kts.
            * heading - direction of travel at last reported position.
            * hiLat - highest latitude travelled by flight.
            * hiLon - highest longitude travelled by flight.
            * ident - flight identifier or registration of aircraft.
            * lastPositionTime - Time when last reported position was received, or 0 if no position has been received yet. Epoch timestamp seconds since 1970.
            * lat - latitude of last reported position.
            * lifeguard - true if a "lifeguard" rescue flight.
            * lon - longitude of last reported position.

            * ogtd - Original Time of Departure. UNIX epoch timestamp seconds since 1970
            * orig - ICAO airport code of origin (for example: KIAH)
            * physClass - physical class (for example: J is jet)
            * prefix - A one or two character identifier prefix code (common values: G or GG Medevac, L Lifeguard, A Air Taxi, H Heavy, M Medium).
            * speed - ground speed, in kts.
            * status - Single letter code for current flight status, can be S Scheduled, F Filed, A Active, Z Completed, or X Cancelled.
            * updateType - data source of last position (P=projected, O=oceanic, Z=radar, A=ADS-B, M=multilateration, D=datalink, X=surface and near surface (ADS-B and ASDE-X), S=space-based).
            * waypoints - all of the intersections and VORs comprising the route

        include both undeparted and en route flights. Flights are ordered by
        `estimated_on` ascending. The optional start and end parameters will
        be compared against `estimated_on` to limit the flights returned. The
        start parameter's default value is 48 hours before the current time
        (this accounts for delayed flights). The end parameter's default value
        is 24 hours after the current time.

        This endpoint is quite similar to the `FindFlight` operator in prior
        versions of AeroAPI. Results may include both non-stop and one-stop
        flights. Note that because the returned flights can include multiple
        legs, the response format differs from most other flight-returning
        endpoints. If the optional start or end query parameters are not
        provided start will default to 1 day in the future, while end will
        default to 7 days in the past relative to the time the query is made.

      summary: Get flight counts for an airport
      description: |
        Returns counts of flights for an airport broken down by flight status.
        The returned categories are subtly different from what is returned from
        the `/airports/{id}/flights` endpoints. Specifically, this operation
        does not include completed flights in its counts, and it does not count
        cancelled/diverted flights. It also does not strictly bound the time
        for which scheduled flights are counted, so all future flights that
        FlightAware knows about are included in the counts. See the response
        schema and documentation for the airport flights endpoints for more
        information.

        if `estimated_off` is missing) ascending. The optional start and end
        parameters will be compared against `scheduled_off` to limit the
        flights returned. If start is not specified, flights with a
        `scheduled_off` or cancellation time no further than two hours into the
        past will be returned. If end is not specified, there is no guaranteed
        bound for how far in the future scheduled flights will be returned (it
        will typically be around 48 hours in the future for commercial flights,
        though).

        Returns flights for this operator that have departed and are currently
        en route, ordered by `estimated_on` ascending. The optional start and
        end parameters will be compared against `estimated_on` to limit the
        flights returned. The start parameter's default value is 48 hours
        before the current time (this accounts for delayed flights). There is
        no default end bound.

      summary: Create new alert
      description: |
        Create a new AeroAPI flight alert. When the alert is triggered, a
        callback mechanism will be used to notify the address set via the
        /alerts/endpoint endpoint. Each callback will be charged as a query and
        count towards usage for the AeroAPI key that created the alert. If this key
        is disabled or removed, the alert will no longer be available.
        If a target_url is provided, then this specific alert will be delivered
        to that address regardless of the adress set via the /alerts/endpoint endpoint.
