      summary: 5 day air quality forecast for coordinates
      description: |
        This endpoint accepts a geographical coordinate and a list of air quality variables and responds with a JSON hourly air quality forecast for 5 days. Time always starts at 0:00 today.
        Forecast is based on the 11 kilometer CAMS European air quality forecast and the 40 kilometer CAMS global atmospheric composition forecasts. The two domains are not coupled and may show different forecasts.
