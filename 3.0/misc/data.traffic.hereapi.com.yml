    functionalClasses:

      description: |
        A list of functional classes separated by commas (`,`), to return results for. The
        functional class is used to group roads depending on the speed, importance, and
        connectivity.

        Functional classes are integers from `1` to `5` inclusive where functional class `1` are
        the most important and functional class `5` are the least important. The table below
        describes the roads that fall into each class.

        | Functional Class | Description |
        |------------------|-------------|
        | 1                | These roads are meant for high volume, maximum speed traffic between and through major metropolitan areas. There are very few, if any, speed changes. Access to this road is usually controlled. |
        | 2                | These roads are used to channel traffic to Main Roads (functionalClass=1) for travel between and through cities in the shortest amount of time. There are very few, if any speed changes. |
        | 3                | These roads interconnect First Class Roads (2) and provide a high volume of traffic movement at a lower level of mobility than First Class Roads (2). |
        | 4                | These roads provide for a high volume of traffic movement at moderate speeds between neighborhoods. These roads connect with higher Functional Class roads to collect and distribute traffic between neighborhoods. |
        | 5                | These roads' volume and traffic movements are below the level of any other road. |

        Return flow items within a geographical area.
        Area within which to return flow.

        A geographic area can be one of the following:

         * A circular area, provided as latitude, longitude, and radius (in meters)

           Format: `circle:{latitude},{longitude};r={radius}`

           Type: `circle:{decimal},{decimal};r={integer}`

           Example: `circle:13.1,-43.1;r=10000`

         * A bounding box, provided as _west longitude_, _south latitude_, _east longitude_, _north latitude_

           Format: `bbox:{west longitude},{south latitude},{east longitude},{north latitude}`

           Example: `bbox:13.08836,52.33812,13.761,52.6755`

         * A corridor, provided as a polyline in
           [Flexible Polyline](https://github.com/heremaps/flexible-polyline) encoding and a
           radius/width (in meters). The radius is measured perpendicular to each segment of the
           polyline on both sides, so a radius of 50 meters will cover an area 50 meters on either
           side of the polyline and be 100 meters wide from one side to the other.

           Format: `corridor:{polyline};r={radius}`

        | `reversibleNotRoutable` | The roadway is reversible but it is currently not routable. See below for further information. |

        This traversability status is the best source of information when routing through reversible
        lanes. This data will be more accurate than any other source, including the base map data,
        as published reversible information can be changed based on daily traffic flow or special
        events.

        The application can deal with reversible not routable in any way, but it is recommended
        that it is used to indicate not routable and to not show traffic on this roadway in map
        display.

        For reversible roads, both directions will be not routable for portions of the day when the
        road direction is being switched.  There is a possibility that portions of a reversible
        road will be marked a `closed` rather than `reversibleNotRoutable`; when this happens, both
        directions of the reversible will be closed, which can happen for construction or major
        accidents.

        The default value is `open`.
